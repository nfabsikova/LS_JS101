//a function that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every other element

/*
Casual:

Given an array of integers.

Initialise a new empty array.

Iterate through the input array with a step of two.
  - in each iteration, push the value at current index into the new array.

Return the new array.

Formal:

START

# Given a collection of integers, called "numbers"

SET newArray = []
FOR iterator = 1 UNTIL iterator < length of numbers BY iterator += 2
  newArray.push(numbers[iterator])
RETURN newArray

END
